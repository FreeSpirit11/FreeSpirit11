### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mansi Yadav , a passionate coder and tech enthusiast. 

Here's a bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my skills in software development and exploring the world of AI and machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and front-end technologies to build interactive and user-friendly applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting open-source projects and innovative ideas that challenge me to grow as a developer.

I'm currently following Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" course on Udemy to master Python development.

âš¡ Fun Fact about Me: I can binge-watch Netflix like a pro! Once I start a series, it's hard to resist the 'Next Episode' button. ðŸ™ƒ

```
watched_episodes = 0
total_episodes = 10  

while watched_episodes < total_episodes:
    watched_episodes += 1
    print(f"Just watched episode {watched_episodes}. Netflix, please stop tempting me with the 'Next Episode' button!")
